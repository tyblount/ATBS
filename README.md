Chapter projects from Automate the Boring Stuff (eBook).
Goal is to complete each chapter and add a little bit more to the project so as to show understanding of the covered topic.
After completing all chapters (or maybe earlier) the plan is to move into The Big Book of Small Python Projects to keep focus and practice basics.
